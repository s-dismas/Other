This is a scan of the Original Douay-Rheims Bible circa 1600.  I
believe I got these from Google books as one large PDF, and then
extracted the individual page images from that. I am using this
version as a secondary source for my project to create a newly typeset
edition of the Douay-Rheims Bible.
